<h3>### Overview</h3>

This repository is dedicated to the lab assignments for the Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems course. It includes code for various AI algorithms implemented as part of the course assignments. Each assignment is organized in a separate directory, containing code, related resources, and documentation.

<h3>### Assignments Included</h3>

<h4>#### 1. 8-Puzzle Solver using A* Algorithm</h4>

The **8-Puzzle Solver** assignment implements an 8-puzzle solver using the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm is employed to find the most efficient solution path by exploring the puzzle's state space.

<h4>#### 2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Minimax Algorithm</h4>

The **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** assignment features a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally against the player.

<h3>### How to Use</h3>

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
<br>
2. **Navigate to the desired assignment directory:** <br>

   ```bash
   cd 8-puzzle
   # or
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
<br>
3. **Run the Python code:** <br> 

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
